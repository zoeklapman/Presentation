This project helped me learn a lot about software engineering. I learned what a Gantt chart is and how helpful it can be to keep track of different steps of a project. 
Also, I learned how important communication is between group members in order to make sure everyone is on track and to help each other out whenever necessary.
One challenge we faced were the limited amount of times we were able to test out our code. Although we got a lot done within the two days we scheduled, there were still 
a lot of improvements that could have been made to the block code. 
Something I feel like I could have done differently was being more involved. Even though I helped oversee a lot of the project it would have been informative to be more hands on with the block code.
However, considering these extraordinary circumstances I understand this was is something that would been very hard to do.
