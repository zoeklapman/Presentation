This project has helped me learn many new things. I understand how block code works now and how it can be used in a device like this. I also learned how to create a Gantt chart which was something that I haven't done before. Something challenging about this project was the amount of trial and error we went through. We had to be patient throughout a project like this in order for it to work. This project helped me work with other people and how to split work up among the members also.
